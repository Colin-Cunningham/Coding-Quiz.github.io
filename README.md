#Project Title: Coding Quiz!

###1. What is this project?

*This project will allow users to test there knowledge in a short coding quiz. The user should be able to answer questions while a timer is running in the top right corner of the window. If the user gets the answer wrong, they receive a 15 second penalty, if they get it right they do not. Regardless of right and wrong they will always move to the next section, at the end of the quiz the time remaining becomes there overall score. This score will then be stored on a high score landing page, with the ability to reset the high score. 
###2. Why did I make this project?

*This project comes in the wake of another project I did which was a random password generator, which taught me how to work in arrays and make functions that have a single purpose of displaying a message on screen. However this generator did not store the password (for obvious security reasons) and the page reset with each refresh. Not only will this project allow me to work in local storage to display repsonses to quiz questions, but will also continue to develop my skills in working in arrays and creating functions.
###3. How did I make this project?

The first thing I did was use bootstrap to create the card, header and container elements, then I created the timer using peices of the tutorial "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u_6CqjQ-L8Q".
New Skills learned * New types of dislpays including grid, and template columns. * Leanred how to cycle through arrays and general overall functions using https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=riDzcEQbX6k&t=331s tutorial. * Added Restart element ass well as next button element.
